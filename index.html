<!--<h1>What is happening now?</h1>-->

<p>
   In 2019, CTAC created a new and comprehensive vetting process to ensure the
   committee is following an improved process for evaluating and reporting
   skills, techniques, and equipment. This new process is designed to help
   create consistency and transparency in how the group comes to decisions. The
   process will also help CTAC create standardized reports on the work that was
   done, so everyone can see how a decision was made.
</p>

<p>
   For more information on our process, see our process guide document located
   <a href="#">here</a>.

<h1>Getting in Touch</h1>

<p>
   CTAC encourages anyone with questions about particular techniques,
   equipment, best practices, etc., to submit a request for investigation here.
   Anyone can submit a request: climb leaders, instructors, course students, or
   the general public are all welcome. CTAC will consider the request at our
   next meeting (occurring monthly, near the end of each month), and determine
   if the request is within our committee's scope. If so, we will prioritize it
   based on our current docket and let you know when you can expect our final
   report.
</p>

<p>
   Submit a request for a report using the button above, or email the committee
   at
   <a href="mailto:ctac.mountaineers@gmail.com">ctac.mountaineers@gmail.com</a>.
